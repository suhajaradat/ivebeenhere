	<h2>WELCOME</h2>
	<article id="writing">
<p>After years of dealing with depression,anxiety and OCD, i steped out of my comfort zone and started lerning programming, and here i am making this website to tell you *anyone who is reading this* that whatever you are dealing with righ now someone out there has been through what you are going through. I myself have been here before and i promise it gets BETTER. I might not be exactly where you are now and i might not know exactly how you feel, but I most certainly know that someone somewhere knows and feels what you feel. You are not alone, you are strong and you are loved.
If you think it's too much, this is totally OK,take your time, visit a psychatric if you can, take your vitamins if possible, and most importantly, move your body. I know that it feels impossible to move your body somedays, but whenever you could, do it. 

<p>I know it's so hard to move when your mental health is not good, i used to skip classes at college because getting out of bed was too much to do, there were days when i could not even brush my hair and i'm telling you, if you are excperiencing this at the moment, alot of people have been here before, including me. as someome once said: 
<q>I did'nt want to wake up. I was having a much better time asleep. And that's really sad. It was almost like a reverse nightmare, like when you wake up from a nightmare you're so relieved. I woke uo into a nightmare.</q > and that, my dear, is all okay. i now know it's ok but back then i didn't have anyone to tell me this. no one told me that i would be able to laugh again or gain weight agian, everyday felt like the hardest day ever and that it would be the last day of my life. Guess what? It got better. It was a very long journey, but i did it.  </p>

<p>I'm not telling you I am the happiest pesron now, but i am better. I learned how to forgive myself, I thaught myself alot of things, it took me years, but i'm here now, feeling better, learning web development at 26, hoping that i would be able to have any thing a normal person has soon. Starting my life from scratch at 26.
<br> 
I am living evidince that it gets better. </p><br></article>
